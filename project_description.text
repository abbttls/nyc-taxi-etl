Project: NYC Taxi ETL & Analytics Platform

Goal: Build a reproducible ETL pipeline and analytics environment for NYC Yellow Taxi data, supporting beginner-friendly data engineering, SQL, and analytics workflows.

Key Steps:
1. Extract: Download and convert raw taxi trip data (Parquet/CSV).
2. Transform: Clean, validate, enrich, and summarize data.
3. Load: Bulk load into Azure SQL; design normalized schemas.
4. Analytics: Store reusable SQL queries, support ad-hoc analysis, and implement advanced analytics (e.g., shortest path between taxi zones using Dijkstra's algorithm in T-SQL).
5. Documentation: Maintain clear, stepwise instructions and reproducibility.
6. Extensibility: Allow new data sources and BI tool integration.
7. Copilot Log: Autonomously track Copilot's suggestions and code changes.

Instructions: Keep responses concise, educational, and beginner-focused. Update this file as project goals or requirements evolve.
